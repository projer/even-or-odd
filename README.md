# even-or-odd
Even or odd project

 Using HTML and JavaScript, an input field is to be implemented which receives as parameter a list of numbers of any length in the form of an
array (space as separator). Additionally, a button should be implemented, which splits the entered list into two lists sorted in ascending order
and displays it on the screen - the first list contains only even numbers, the second - only odd numbers.
